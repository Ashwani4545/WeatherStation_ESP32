IoT-Based Weather Station Using ESP32
Introduction
An IoT-based weather station using ESP32 is a smart system that collects and transmits real-time weather data to the cloud for remote access. The ESP32 is ideal for this project due to its Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities, low power consumption, and high processing power.

This system can measure multiple environmental parameters like:
✔️ Temperature & Humidity (DHT11/DHT22)
✔️ Air Pressure & Altitude (BMP280)
✔️ Light Intensity (LDR Sensor)
✔️ Rainfall (Rain Sensor)
✔️ Wind Speed & Direction (Anemometer & Wind Vane, optional)

Users can view the weather data on:
📌 OLED/LCD display (local monitoring)
📌 ThingSpeak/Firebase/Web Dashboard (remote monitoring)
📌 Mobile App (Blynk/Home Assistant)
